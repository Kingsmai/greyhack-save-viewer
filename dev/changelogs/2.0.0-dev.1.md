# ðŸ“¦ CHANGELOG

## [2.0.0-alpha] - 2025-04-30

> Initial push of the 2.0 refactor â€” focused on **player information parsing and visualization**

### âœ¨ Added

- Implemented **player main information** viewer:
  - Player ID
  - Main Computer & Rented Server list (with UUIDs)
  - Player location (`infoMapX`, `infoMapY`)
  - Game over count
  - Last connection time
  - Bank account number
  - Email address
- Implemented **player storage inventory**:
  - Device lists categorized by type (Hard Disk, CPU, GPU, RAM, PSU, Motherboard, Network Devices)
  - Detailed view for each item
- Added **selling hardware shop** data listing
- Temporarily integrated incomplete fields under "Player Details":
  - Wallet ID & Password
  - Login Data (rendered as a code block)

### ðŸ”§ In Progress

- Mission list structure discovered, but meaning of certain fields (e.g., reputation/karma enum) still under investigation
- Double-click interaction to jump from player to their main computer: *Not yet implemented*
- Placeholder structure for upcoming features (e.g., stock info, zero day request, bank traces)

### ðŸ“‰ Known Limitations

- Mission parsing is partial and needs further reverse-engineering
- Wallet, stock, and trace-related fields return no data in current save samples
- Device and enum values are not yet translated into human-readable format

ðŸ“Œ *This version serves as the foundational structure of v2.0. Feedback and contributions are welcome as the viewer evolves!*
