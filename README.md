# GreyHack Save Viewer

🔍 **A lightweight save file viewer for _Grey Hack_, built with Godot Engine.**  
**Explore your Grey Hack world data with ease!**

> [!important] This project is only for single_player save files since the multi-player save files are saved on the official server and I don't have access to them.
